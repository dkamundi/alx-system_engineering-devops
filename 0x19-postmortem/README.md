**Issue Summary:**
Outage Duration: August 10, 2023, 08:00 AM - August 11, 2023, 02:00 AM (UTC)
Impact: Slow performance and intermittent unavailability of our online marketplace platform. Users experienced delays in loading product pages and completing transactions. Approximately 25% of users were affected.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the outage was identified as a database connection leak. An internal service was improperly closing database connections, leading to resource exhaustion and subsequent degradation in performance.

**Timeline:**
- August 10, 2023, 09:15 AM: Issue detected through a surge in latency and error rate alerts on our monitoring dashboard.
- August 10, 2023, 09:30 AM: Engineers initiated initial investigation, suspecting a network-related problem.
- August 10, 2023, 10:00 AM: Network investigation revealed no anomalies; focus shifted to application-level services.
- August 10, 2023, 11:30 AM: Teams noticed an unusual pattern in database connection logs, leading to suspicion of connection leaks.
- August 10, 2023, 01:00 PM: Further investigation confirmed the existence of connection leaks. Incident escalated to the database team.
- August 10, 2023, 03:30 PM: Database team determined the root cause as improper connection handling.
- August 10, 2023, 04:00 PM: Temporary workaround implemented to mitigate the issue and stabilize the platform.
- August 10, 2023, 07:00 PM: Long-term fix identified and development initiated.
- August 11, 2023, 02:00 AM: Permanent fix deployed, and platform performance fully restored.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**
The issue was caused by an internal service not releasing database connections properly. This led to an increasing number of open connections, causing resource exhaustion and degrading the overall performance of the platform.

To fix the issue, the development team rewrote the connection handling logic in the affected service. Proper connection closure and recycling mechanisms were implemented to prevent leaks. Additionally, monitoring and alerting were enhanced to quickly identify and react to similar issues in the future.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
1. Improve Code Review: Implement stricter code review processes to catch potential resource leaks during development.
2. Enhanced Monitoring: Set up real-time monitoring for database connection usage, resource utilization, and application performance to proactively identify anomalies.
3. Regular Audits: Conduct regular audits to ensure that connection handling best practices are followed across all services.
4. Automated Testing: Develop automated tests to simulate high load scenarios and verify proper connection management under stress.
5. Documentation Update: Update documentation with best practices for handling database connections and resource management.

**Tasks to Address the Issue:**
1. Apply the permanent fix to all production instances.
2. Conduct a thorough review of connection handling in other services.
3. Update the incident response playbook to include steps for addressing database-related performance issues.
4. Provide training to development teams on proper database connection management.
5. Implement post-deployment monitoring checks to catch any regression related to connection handling.

This outage highlighted the critical importance of proper resource management, especially when it comes to database connections. Through a combination of code improvements, enhanced monitoring, and proactive measures, we aim to prevent similar incidents and ensure a seamless user experience on our platform.
